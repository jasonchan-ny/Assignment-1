      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>The University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth is one of the nation’s premier graduate academic medical centers, with six schools that specialize in patient-centered education, research and health care.</p>
      <p>Sustainability at UNTHSC is an effort that brings together the work of students, faculty, and staff alike.  Representatives from across campus, has provided the leadership and coordination for this effort.</p>
      <h2>Join us!</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. Our vision is a world where the diversity of life thrives, and people act to conserve nature for its own sake and its ability to fulfill our needs and enrich our lives.</p>
      <p>If you’re here, you care about our planet’s future. And, if you’re just opening up to this thought, this idea of a sustainable world, we’re stoked to have you, too. Because it takes all of us.
      <p>People are becoming conscious of the power of their purchases. They’re not only waking up to the value of the environment, but the fact that one purchasing decision can tip the balance. As a community, we’re changing companies’ habits, other consumers’ opinions and tastes, and even public policy. Every purchase we make doesn’t just support a company, it supports a movement to turn our manufacturing system inside out.</p>
      <p>We know change starts from the ground up, with businesses who are already working hard to do good. So we reached out to them­–innovators and designers finding better options for everyday problems. ­­­People who had a need for something and wanted to find the best possible way to create it, for our kids, our friends, our neighbors, and our planet.</p>
      <p>And together, our story is just beginning.</p>
