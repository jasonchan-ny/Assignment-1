        <h1>SUSTAINABILITY</h1>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>Our campus is committed to improving the health and quality of life
            of Texans and beyond. Sustainability supports that mission by striving
            to improve the environmental health and quality of life for our campus
            and community. Sustainability is important for many reasons including:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Environmental Quality – In order to have healthy communities, we
            need clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    UNTHSC’s enrollment continues to grow, so we require
            more resources such as energy, water, and space. Sustainability
            aims to use our resources efficiently to benefit our campus and
            community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Healthcare – Sustainability and healthcare are intricately related
            since the quality of our environment affects public health. For
            example, many health issues are directly related to air and
            water quality.
                </li>
            </ul>
